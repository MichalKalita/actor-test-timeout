# Timeout-based Actor

This Actor runs for a specified timeout duration and logs progress every second. Once the timeout is complete, it pushes data containing the timeout value, elapsed time, and a completion message.

## Purpose

The purpose of this Actor is to test other tooling to ensure timeout handling is implemented correctly.

## Additional Information

This Actor does not use the internet or scrape any website. It is designed solely for timeout-based functionality testing.
